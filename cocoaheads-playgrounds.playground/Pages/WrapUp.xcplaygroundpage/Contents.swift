 ## Benefits
 
 * Useful when starting a new feature on production code: iterate quickly before diving into production
    * A great way to find creative solutions to day-to-day problems, abstrating production issues
 * Also on "How does this work in swift?" moments
    * A great way to dive in the most advanced language feature and master it
 
 ## Concerns
 
 * Still hard to integrate projects / frameworks
 
 ## Resources
 
 * [Apple XCPlaygrounds reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/XCPlaygroundModuleRef/XCPlayground.html)
 * [Use Pods Frameworks in playgrounds (github)](https://github.com/neonichu/ThisCouldBeUsButYouPlaying)
